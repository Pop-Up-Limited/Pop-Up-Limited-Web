</ul>

<h3 id="legal-bases" class="section">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>

<p><em>In Short:</em> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

<p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>

<p>

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

</p>

<ul>

  <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>

  <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>

  <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:

    <ul>

      <li>Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services;</li>

      <li>Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users;</li>

      <li>Support our marketing activities;</li>

      <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities;</li>

      <li>Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience;</li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>

  <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></p>

<p>

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.

</p>

<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>

<ul>

  <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way;</li>

  <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention;</li>

  <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met;</li>

  <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim;</li>

  <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin;</li>

  <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse;</li>

  <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province;</li>

  <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records;</li>

  <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced;</li>

  <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes;</li>

  <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations;</li>

  <li>We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments.</li>

<p><em>In Short:</em> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>

<p>

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services.

</p>

<p>

We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.

</p>

<p>

To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?"

</p>

<p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our <a href="https://popup.limited/cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookie Notice</a>.</p>

<p>

If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform. We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy notices of the companies that provide them.

</p>

<h3 id="retention" class="section">8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

<p><em>In Short:</em> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than <strong>three (3) months past the start of the idle period of the user's account</strong>.

</p>

<p>

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

</p>

<h3 id="minors" class="section">9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>

<p><em>In Short:</em> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>

By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age (or the equivalent age) has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18 (or the equivalent age), please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@popup.limited">contact@popup.limited</a>.

</p>

<h3 id="rights" class="section">10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

<p><em>In Short:</em> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>

<p>

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us using the contact details provided below.

</p>

<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority. If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>

<p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.</p>

<p><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by contacting us using the details provided below. We may still communicate with you for service purposes.</p>

<p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases, subject to retention required for legal obligations.</p>

<h3 id="dnt" class="section">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

<p>

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. Because no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

</p>

<p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>

<h3 id="us-rights" class="section">12. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

<p><em>In Short:</em> If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable law.</p>
